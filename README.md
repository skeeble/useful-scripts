This is a collection of useful scripts I use to automate the management of servers, processes etc. I give no warranty of quality 
etc. If you find a problem and can fix / improve these scripts, please do and create a pull request.

my prior written authorisation, and be careful, most are tuned to the stacks I use and may be volitile outside of their intended 
environments
